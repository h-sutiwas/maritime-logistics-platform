# Maritime Logistics Intelligence Project
A comprehensive data engineering and machine learning project designed to optimize container shipping operations, demonstrating end-to-end data pipeline development, real-time analytics, and predictive modeling for maritime logistics.

## Business Context & Problem Statement
The maritime shipping industry faces complex operational challenges including vessel routing optimization, accurate arrival time predictions, and efficient container deployment across trade routes. This project addresses these challenges by providing data-driven insights that improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer service delivery.

### Key Business Problems Addressed
- Vessel arrival time uncertainty affecting supply chain planning
- Suboptimal route selection leading to increased fuel costs and delays
- Inefficient container allocation resulting in capacity underutilization
- Limited real-time visibility into fleet operations and port performance
